# What are some types of testing that we have covered?

- Unit Tests (TDD) -> One part -> We are testing to see if the icing machine works on its own
- Regression Testing -> Version changes
- Integration Testing -> How one part fits with the rest of the code. -> Test run with a smaller batch of cakes to see if it works with the rest of the factory
- end-to-end - testing the app like a user(we will learn this in the next lecture)
- manual -  the dev is running the code
